Each vertical corresponds to a relevant unit of data analytics and is problem-specific. As a rule of thumb, _If you are in the healthcare industry, <a domain> can be a hospital or a specific department such as radiology._ The idea is then to apply Agile-based principles to ensure delivery of one domain at a time (= Agile work increment) as a finished data product (criteria under `2. Principle of Data as a Product`) for data scientists (= Agile customer). Discovery phases are then expected to shorten thanks to the better-defined deliverable for data scientists. | 2022
